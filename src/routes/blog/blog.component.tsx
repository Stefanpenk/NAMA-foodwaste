            We are lucky to be able to choose what we eat, because many people
            around the world don't have that same choice. Canadian households
            toss out about $1,300 worth of food a year, while Americans waste
            about $2,000 worth annually. If we add restaurants, grocery stores,
            farms, etc. we are wasting â€“ $31 billion in Canada and $165 billion
            in the U.S.

            Fortunately, there are many things we can do at home to reduce food
            waste, and there are tons of zero-waste recipes you can easily make
            in your kitchen with basic tools.
